# Exploratory-data-analysis-on-US-Accidents
Traffic accidents can be fatal. Reducing traffic accidents is an essential safety challenge all  over the world. The objective of the project is to analyse the US Road Accident data from  49 states and establish trends and possible factors that cause traffic accidents and what  could be done to prevent and subside them. Government agencies and the general public can leverage these insights and take preventive measures which may help reduce US Road Accidents. The main findings from the project focus on Infrastructure, Policy, Administrative, and  Human behaviour changes that can be implemented by the State and the Federal  Government.
